# Airbnb Analysis

## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, and develop interactive visualizations to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

## Tools
- **Python**: Scripting, Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit)
- **Streamlit**: Web Application Development for interactive maps
- **MongoDB Atlas**: NoSQL Database for data storage and retrieval
- **Tableau or Power BI**: Dashboard creation for comprehensive data presentation

## Approach
1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**: Establish connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and transform data types.
3. **Geospatial Visualization**: Develop interactive maps using Streamlit to visualize listing distribution.
4. **Price Analysis**: Visualize price variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
5. **Availability Analysis**: Analyze and visualize occupancy rates and demand fluctuations by season.
6. **Location-Based Insights**: Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
7. **Interactive Visualizations**: Enable users to filter and drill down into the data.
8. **Dashboard Creation**: Combine visualizations in Power BI for a comprehensive view.

## Learning Outcomes
- Proficiency in MongoDB Atlas for data management
- Building interactive web applications with Streamlit
- Python expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Geospatial analysis using libraries like GeoPandas and Folium
- Creating interactive dashboards with Power BI
